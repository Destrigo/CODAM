One month without AI and for sure this is going to be written by it:

# Codam Piscine ‚Äî July 2025

Welcome to my repository for the Codam July 2025 Piscine!  
This repo contains all the exercises and projects I completed during the month-long selection process at [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/).

## üôè Acknowledgments

First and foremost, a huge thank you to Codam for the opportunity to be part of such an intense, inspiring, and transformative experience. The learning environment, support, and structure of the Piscine are truly something special.

To my fellow Pisciners ‚Äî thank you for the late-night debugging sessions, the shared frustration, the nutella pancakes and the endless laughs. You made this journey unforgettable.

Thanks again for stopping by!
